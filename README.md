# PyBer_Analysis

1.	Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

The purpose of this analysis was to analyze the difference in the fare of a rideshare based on the type of city in which the ride occurred.



2.	Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

In the following data, we can see that the average fare per ride and driver are highest in Rural areas and lowest in Urban areas. This is likely because there are so few drivers in Rural areas compared to Urban areas, but the demand for ridesharing in both areas is about the same, which results in the major increase in price in the area with lower supply.

However, the opposite result is displayed when looking at Total Fares. Not only is that the case in the data shown above, but also in the graph below. The supply of drivers in Urban areas outweighs that of Rural areas so much, that the difference in Fare Per Ride is negligible. Ultimately the number of drivers and therefore the number of rides yields a significantly greater total fare during any time period.

3.	Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
One recommendation could be to position a greater number of drivers in rural areas in order to take advantage of the greater fare prices per driver. Another recommendation could be to do the same for suburban areas as well, for the same reason. The last recommendation could be to position the drivers in Urban areas overnight â€“ during this time, most public transportation in Urban areas is closed and most people in Rural and Suburban areas are asleep, which would make it the ideal time to position the most drivers in Urban areas due to significantly higher demand.
